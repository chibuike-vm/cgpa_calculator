# University CGPA Calculator Project (Global Standard)

The _University CGPA Calculator_ is very smart and interactive. It was created  
using the implementation of the **C** concept of callback functions where  
function pointers are passed as arguements into another function and  
subsequently called within the function scope of that function. The betty-style  
coding formatting standard was used.

## Preferred Compilers
